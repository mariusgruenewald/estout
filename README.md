High-quality Latex Wrapper for estimation output obtained in Python (Jupyter).

This wrapper is made to produce publication-style tables with focus on causal analysis for LaTeX. Currently handles simple linear regressions.
LaTeX code is generated in the output window and can be copy-pasted to the LaTex file you're currently writing in.

Future Updates likely include more linear estimation techniques as well as predictions done with scikit-learn.
